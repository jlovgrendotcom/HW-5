You and your partner should build a jQuery Mobile app that is very similar to the two I went over in class (Notes and Movies).
It must:
•	have 3 "pages", each with the header, content and footnote sections, as well as a NavBar
•	home page should describe what the web site does
•	another page should let a user enter data, must have at least 4 pieces of data, at least one of which is selected with a drop down Select element
•	this data should be collected and stored in an object making use of an object constructor function, and stored in an array.
•	3rd page should display the data. It should use a pagebeforeshow  event so that when the user navigates to this page, the data is shown automatically, no buttons.
•	Your header and footer's should have some kind of image consistent with the theme of the web site.
•	Use the data-theme='e', with some interesting mic of a, b, c, d, or e for each of the 3 sections on the 3 pages
•	Adding a sort button on the 3rd page is not required, but it would be a good thing to do!
Submit a GitHub link.
There are many ways a team could split this work, I will offer 1 idea just as a suggestion.
Person 1
•	create the GitHub repo
•	build a skeleton 3 page, 3 sections project, and push it to GitHub
•	build page 2, which collects info and saves it into an array
•	sets the the data-theme values to make the site look good
Person 2
•	add the NavBar
•	adds some words to the homepage
•	build page 3, which uses a pagebeforeshow, and displays the data
•	adds images to headers, footers, and one image in the home page content section
